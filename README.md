# Studget

Student financing Android app created for the Edinburgh Napier hackathon in 2018.

# How it works
* Based on a monthly plan
* Start with a blaence of 100.0 (budget example).
* Use the buttons to add either a category or a transaction.
* Each category denotes a budgetable set of items that can be bought.
* Once the category button is pressed the user can add a category and its budget for the month.
* If the category is too expensive then it will drop down into a list of inaffordable categories for the month, if its an affordable category it will be put into the affordable category list. 
* Each list can be prioritised to have the most important categories at the top.
* The idea is that an algorithm works out what you can afford each month based on your priorisation of categories and budget.

# Prototype
